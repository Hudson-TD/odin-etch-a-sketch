# Description

This project demonstrates my ability to use complex DOM manipulation to dynamically produce grid elements of varying sizes. The project also illustrates familiarity with the Window object and the ability to interact with users through prompts with logic to protect against inputs outside of the scope of the application. User interaction with the application is predominantly handled with the addEventListener method. Thank you for taking the time to check out this project!
